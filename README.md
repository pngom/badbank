# Bad Bank Exercise <img src="https://d3srxiunz7lgh6.cloudfront.net/absvbe0kj84117vh7z2uj39tlyb9" alt="MIT Coding Program" width="20%">

This project is an assignment that I completed to fulfill the requirements of the [MIT Professional Certificate in Coding using MERN.](https://executive-ed.xpro.mit.edu/professional-certificate-coding?u)  

It is called Bad Bank because the collected user credentials are displayed on a page!

The following learning outcomes are met:
* **Build, test, and deploy a React application**
* **Design and build UI components using React**

The assignment involved refactoring and building functionality to produce website pages with good user experience:
1. Navigation bar: includes routing for responsiveness/fast loading, bootstrap styling, highlighting and mouse hover effects for a better viewing experience
2. Create Account page: displays in a styled card input fields with relevant validation to collect user data (name, email, password). Displays event alerts.
3. Account deposit page: displays in a styled card a deposit input field with relevant validation, the account balance and an event alert
4. Account withdrawal page: displays in a styled card a withdrawal input field with relevant validation, the account balance and an event alert
5. All Data page: displays in a styled table users' data collected in the Create Account page

## Repository File Structure
There are various folders/files listed in this repository that map to the pages or utilities: 

* [public folder](https://github.com/pngom/badbank/tree/main/public) containing the index.html file and the index.js file
* [src folder](https://github.com/pngom/badbank/tree/main/src) containing a pages folder (in it 5 .jsx files mapping to the 5 pages above), a components folder (in it the Navbar files) and a utils folder (in it the context file that defines global state variables)
* [package.json](https://github.com/pngom/badbank/blob/main/package.json) containing all dependencies installed with npm to build the react app

## Roadmap of future improvements
Build features to reproduce the basic original Pacman game:
- add a login page
- add a back end functionality
